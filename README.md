This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a presentation on false news found on Google's interface. The presentation's source code uses the
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) framework to control the display of each slide. The presentation uses gkapfham/seke2015-panel-presentation as a starting template, but each slide is customized to pertain to issued topic. 


Now, you can navigate [The Crackdown on False News](http://cdn.rawgit.com/myersj451/FS102-news_presentation-myersj451/master/fake_news.html#/) locally.
